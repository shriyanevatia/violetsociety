The Violet Society website
==========================

The Violet Society is a startup sisterhood for future founders. We are focused on undergraduate women in the Greater Boston Area.

The Violet Society is named after Violet Baudelaire from A Series of Unfortunate Events. Like the character, members are inventive, creative, and resourceful problem-solvers. Members are encouraged to create things and share them with the community in a supportive and helpful environment.

Young women who join The Violet Society will have access to a close-knit group of diverse individuals who are willing to work together to make their ideas into realities. We are looking for makers, dreamers, and doers. Through the organization, members can meet people from other schools by attending tech events, hackathons, social gatherings, and educational workshops.
