      <h2>Shriya Nevatia <small>Founder</small></h2>
      <p>Shriya is an undergraduate at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science. She was inspired to create The Violet Society after her experiences in an Entrepreneurship class at Tufts and in classes by General Assembly, Web Start Women, and Girl Develop It. She saw a need for a close social and intellectual network of young women who could start businesses together to enhance their skills, gain experience and knowledge, foster close friendships, create an entrepreneurial network, and craft the careers of their dreams! This summer she is a UX Design Intern at Pegasystems. She has previously been involved in Breakthrough Collaborative, a teaching internship that taught her the power of education and was a model of an amazing work environment, and Project Breaker, a unique and inspiring experience that helped her delve into Design Thinking and Social Entrepreneurship. In her free time she enjoys dancing, exploring Boston, and reading business magazines. <a href="http://shriyanevatia.github.io/">Personal site</a></p>

Her other interests include doing anything creative, active, or spontaneous. <a href="http://www.mccallbliss.com">Personal site</a></p>

      <h2>Elizabeth Hagearty <small>Silicon Valley VP of Development</small></h2>
      <p>Elizabeth is a 3rd year at the University of California, Berkeley double majoring in Computer Science and Gender Women's Studies. After becoming involved in meet-ups through Girl Develop it, Women Who Code and Women Coding Collective, she was able to meet other young women in CS but realized that a group for our particular needs was missing. Being very passionate about empowering women in the technology industry, Elizabeth joined The Violet Society with hopes of bringing this network out to undergraduate and young professional women in the Bay Area.  Last summer, she interned at Spokepoint, a startup based out of Cambridge, Massachusetts, working on front-end web development and backend data analysis. Other passions of hers are photography, music and anything nautical.</p>
