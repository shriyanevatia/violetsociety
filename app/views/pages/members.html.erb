	<h3>Founder: Shriya Nevatia </h3>
	<p>Shriya is an undergraduate at Tufts University double-majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. She was inspired to create The Violet Society after her experiences in an Entrepreneurship class at Tufts and in classes by General Assembly, Web Start Women, and Girl Develop It. She saw a need for a close social and intellectual network of young women who could start businesses together to enhance their skills, gain experience and knowledge, foster close friendships, create an entrepreneurial network, and craft the careers of their dreams! She has previously been involved in Breakthrough Collaborative, a teaching internship that taught her the power of education and was a model of an amazing work environment, and Project Breaker, a unique and inspiring experience that helped her delve into Design Thinking and Social Entrepreneurship. In her free time she enjoys dancing, cooking, and reading magazines. Twitter: @shriyanevatia</p>
